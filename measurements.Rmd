## Load libraries

library(igraph)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidygraph)
library(networkD3)
library(visNetwork)
library(knitr) # For table rendering

## Graph object
```{r}

veccol = c(rep("pink",5), rep("light blue",6))
g = graph_from_data_frame(df)
```

## Graph measurements
* adhesion (edge connectivity) or cohesion (vertex connectivity)
* assortativity
* diameter
* girth
* radius
* mutual_count
* edge density
* automorphisms
* unconn_count
* size
* reciprocity
* mean_dist

<br>

## Size
Counts the number of edges in the graph
```{r}
gsize(g)
```

<br>

## Order
Order (number of vertices) of a graph
```{r}
gorder(g)
```

<br>

## Eccentricity
The eccentricity of a vertex is its shortest path distance from the farthest other node in the graph.

![](images/graph6.png)

<br>


```{r}
plot(g,edge.arrow.mode=0,vertex.label.cex=0.8,vertex.label.dist=3)
eccentricity(g)
```

<br>


## Diameter
A network diameter is the longest geodesic distance (length of the shortest path between two nodes) in the network. 

In igraph, 

* diameter() returns the distance
* get_diameter() returns the nodes along the first found path of that distance.

<br>

```{r}
plot(g,edge.arrow.mode=0,vertex.label.cex=0.8,vertex.label.dist=3)
diameter(g)
```

<br>


```{r}
diam <- get_diameter(g, directed=T)
diam
```

<br>

### Color nodes along the diameter
```{r}
vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(g))
vcol[diam] <- "gold"
ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(g))
ecol[E(g, path=diam)] <- "orange" 
plot(g, 
     vertex.color=vcol, 
     edge.color=ecol, 
     edge.arrow.mode=0,
     vertex.label.cex=0.8,
     vertex.label.dist=3
     )
```

<br>

## Radius
The eccentricity of a vertex is its shortest path distance from the farthest other node in the graph. The smallest eccentricity in a graph is called its radius. The eccentricity of a vertex is calculated by measuring the shortest distance from (or to) the vertex, to (or from) all vertices in the graph, and taking the maximum.

```{r}
eccentricity(g)
radius(g)
```


<br>


## Girth
The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest circle in it. In graph theory, the girth of a graph is the length of a shortest cycle contained in the graph.[1] If the graph does not contain any cycles (i.e. it's an acyclic graph), its girth is defined to be infinity.[2] For example, a 4-cycle (square) has girth 4. A grid has girth 4 as well, and a triangular mesh has girth 3. A graph with girth four or more is triangle-free. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory)

![](images/graph10.png)

<br>

```{r}
set.seed(7) 
gir = girth(g)
print(gir)
veccol = rep("gold", vcount(g))
veccol[which(names(V(g)) %in% names(gir$circle))]="blue"
plot(g, vertex.color = veccol)
```

<br>

## Edge density
The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network. This denotes how dense a graph is. A dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges. The opposite, a graph with only a few edges, is a sparse graph. 

![](images/edgedensity.png)


```{r}
# Ignore the edges connecting same node. i.e. edge between node A to A
# max edge: N*(N-1) where N is total nodes
# if e is total edge, then edge density is e/N*(N-1)
edge_density(g, loops=F)

# Include the edges connecting same node. i.e. edge between node A to A
# max edge: N*N where N is total nodes
# if e is total edge, then edge density is e/N*N
edge_density(g, loops=T)

ecount(g)/(vcount(g)*(vcount(g)-1))
```

<br>


## Group Adhesion or Cohesion
Group Adhesion (Edge connectivity) or Cohesion (Vertex connectivity)

What we call cohesion is the contribution made by (adding or subtracting) individual members of a group, together with their ties, to holding it together. What we call adhesion (edge cohesion) is the contribution made to holding a group together—keeping membership constant—by (adding or subtracting) ties between its members. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0081-1750.00098 

Connectivity of a graph: A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every pair of vertex. From every vertex to any other vertex, there should be some path to traverse. That is called the connectivity of a graph. A graph with multiple disconnected vertices and edges is said to be disconnected.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/graph_theory/graph_theory_connectivity.htm

Connected graph

Disconnected graph
![](images/connectivity1.jpg) 

In the above example, traversing from vertex ‘a’ to vertex ‘f’ is not possible because there is no path between them directly or indirectly. Hence it is a disconnected graph.

<br>


### Adhesion (Edge connectivity)

* The **edge connectivity of a pair of vertices** (source and target) is the minimum number of edges needed to remove to eliminate all (directed) paths from source to target.
* The **edge connectivity lambda of the graph G** is the minimum number of edges that need to be deleted, such that the graph G gets disconnected.

https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/edge_vertex_connectivity.html#toc-tgt-1

For example an already disconnected graph has an edge connectivity of 0

A connected graph with at least one bridge has an edge connectivity of 1

A connected graph with no bridges has an edge connectivity of at least 2.

```{r}
g1 = graph.union(graph.ring(9), graph.star(10, c=9, mode="undirected"))
plot(g1)

# we need to remove 2 edge (1-9 and 1-2) to make 1 disconnected from 6
edge_connectivity(g1, 1, 6)

# we need to remove 1 edge (9-10) to make 10 disconnected from 9
edge_connectivity(g1, 1, 10)

# Therefore Graph's edge connectivity is 1
edge_connectivity(g1)

# In our example, edge connectivity is 1 since minimum number of edges that need to be deleted to make a graph disconnected is 1 which is deletion of edge 9-10
edge_connectivity(as.undirected(g1))
```

<br>


### Cohesion (Vertex connectivity)
The vertex connectivity of two vertices (source and target) in a directed graph is the minimum number of vertices needed to remove from the graph to eliminate all (directed) paths from source to target. vertex_connectivity calculates this quantity if both the source and target arguments are given and they're not NULL. Note that this quantity is not defined if source and target are adjacent.

```{r}
plot(g1)
vertex_connectivity(g1, 1, 6)
vertex_connectivity(g1)
```
